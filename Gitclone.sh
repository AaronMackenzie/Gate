#The software package "Kite_trade" is a Python program designed to facilitate interaction with the website https://kite.zerodha.com. 
#It serves the specific purpose of enabling algorithmic trading without relying on the official Kite API and accessing a Zerodha account. 
#This approach circumvents the need for a subscription to the Kite API, which typically starts at â‚¹4000 per month.


#To obtain the necessary files for utilizing the "Kite_trade" program, execute the following command in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/TradeViaPython/Kite_Zerodha.git

#This command clones the repository containing the "kite_trade.py" file onto your local machine. 
#It is essential to have the "kite_trade.py" file in the same directory as your algorithmic trading program whenever building such a program. 
#The "kite_trade.py" file can be found within the "Kite_Zerodha" repository.
